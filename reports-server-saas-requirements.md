SaaS Deployment Strategy Requirements - Reports Server

Project: Kyverno Report Server SaaS Deployment  
Owner: Anuj Ramola  
Objective: Deploy Kyverno Report Server into SaaS environments using phased rollout

Deployment Phases

Phase 1: Development Deployment

Goals:
- Validate installation in real-world N4K SaaS setup
- Confirm GitOps deployment with ArgoCD
- Test with existing workloads

Tasks:
- Deploy N4K 1.14 + Report Server in Dev environment
- Monitor critical metrics:
  - API latency and throttling
  - Kyverno CPU & memory usage
  - etcd metrics (report size, load)

Phase 2: Production Deployment

Goals:
- Full deployment of N4K 1.14 + Report Server with etcd
- Confirm scale-readiness for production workloads
- Continuous observability through Grafana and Prometheus

SaaS Deployment Strategy

| Area | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| GitOps | Use ArgoCD + Git for infrastructure-as-code deployments |
| Resource Optimization | Monitor and tune Kyverno pod limits |
| Storage Strategy | Ensure etcd and PostgreSQL are adequately scaled |
| Alerting | Add Prometheus rules for Report Server metrics |
| Rollback Plan | Maintain dual-write (optional) during migration windows |

Key Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Query |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Reports Server Average Latency | Average response time for report operations in seconds | `rate(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum{group=~"reports.kyverno.io\|wgpolicyk8s.io",resource=~".*reports.*"}[5m]) / rate(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_count{group=~"reports.kyverno.io\|wgpolicyk8s.io",resource=~".*reports.*"}[5m])` |
| Reports Server Request Rate | Number of report requests per second | `rate(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_count{group=~"reports.kyverno.io\|wgpolicyk8s.io",resource=~".*reports.*"}[5m])` |
| Reports Server P95 Latency | 95th percentile latency for report operations | `histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_bucket{group=~"reports.kyverno.io\|wgpolicyk8s.io",resource=~".*reports.*"}[5m]))` |

Performance Targets:
- Average latency: < 1 second
- P95 latency: < 2 seconds  
- Request rate: Monitor for capacity planning

Monitoring & Observability

Core Monitoring Areas:
- API performance and throttling metrics
- CPU and memory resource utilization
- etcd/PostgreSQL storage monitoring
- Log ingestion from Report Server for error validation

Tooling:
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting
- ArgoCD for GitOps deployment management

Technical Requirements

Infrastructure:
- N4K 1.14 compatibility
- etcd backend for storage
- PostgreSQL database support
- ArgoCD integration for GitOps

Operational:
- Phased rollout capability (Dev → Staging → Production)
- Rollback mechanisms with optional dual-write
- Comprehensive logging and error tracking
- Resource scaling strategies for production readiness

Success Criteria

- Successful deployment in Dev environment with all monitoring functional
- Validated compatibility with existing SaaS workloads
- Production-ready scaling and performance metrics
- Complete observability stack operational
- Rollback procedures tested and documented
